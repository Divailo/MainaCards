# MainaCards
A project for the First year hackathon, King's College London. Full description of the game will follow later.
The game is really simple. The computer gets the first card in the deck and shows it to you. Then you have to bet whether
the next card in the deck will be with a higher rank or it will be lower. Suit does not matter at all. The game ends if
there are no cards left in the deck or until your first mistake. Hope you have fun.

As it was done for a small hackathon, the code feels bad, but hopeufully someday will be edited and get at least
readable.
